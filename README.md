# Grafted-the-Story

The guild was more like a tavern than Kel would’ve liked. Noisy full of ruckus and ruffians. But… There was promise.

Quite a few interesting individuals. Not interesting in the way he was used to, but interesting nonetheless. Many were muscular and wore or carried items of obviously magical make. Straight swords and lances, great axes, and war hammers, staffs, and staves of all kinds. A few people carried bows or more exotic ranged weapons, but no guns were in evidence. Everyone standing about seemed to be doing something, their eyes alert and purposeful. Kel liked that. It meant there was intent behind their actions which indicated functioning brains. Good. Good starting stock. Not the best, but he wasn't looking for the highest quality at the moment. When exploring a new skill set it was often best to start simple.

They were mostly humans, but with the odd dwarf or something more exotic here and there. A few specimens he couldn’t identify. One was tall, vaguely feminine and whose deep maroon flesh straddled the line between wood and skin. Some kind of dryad, perhaps? Her red and gold sari caught his eye and Kel made a note to approach her later. In his experience, a dryad wearing clothes was a bit odd. But who knew? Things quite likely worked differently here. Regardless, he’d make an effort to work with her later. It had been a long time since he worked with any kind of plant race. Alas, she was surrounded by a party of seven other persons, one of the largest groups in the building. That was fine. He would approach her later.

If he was lucky, she’d frequent dark alleys. Though… his knife was fairly basic. Perhaps a woodcutter's ax would be better for dismemberment, then?

For the moment, Kel simply waited in line until it was his turn to approach a clerk. 

When it was finally his turn, Kel approached the counter with a frown. The pudgy creature sitting behind the counter was an utter disappointment. To Kel. To his ancestors too, most probably. Poor bone structure, a scraggly beard that hinted at poor gene expression, ears like cauliflower and glassy eyes. His short, curly hair looked like it hadn’t been washed in days and the plethora of pimples on the man-child’s face suggested either a poor diet, even worse genetics, or a state of wash similar to, if not greater than the clerk’s hair. Honestly, Kel wasn’t sure what species this beast was. A deformed human, maybe? He couldn’t see a dwarf being so thin or any form of elf being so deformed.

“Sir. Please approach the counter.”

Kel stared. He was in shock. He honestly hadn’t thought the beast capable of speech.

“...Sir. The counter.”

Kel blinked. 

“Yes? What of it?” He asked, equally baffled and irritated.

“Approach it and state your business today with us, sir.”

The woman clerk seated to the pudgy thing’s left elbowed him and coughed. A social signal no doubt. But of what kind? Kel watched on, unmoving. He couldn’t approach the counter without seeing how this turn of events would end. 

Except nothing else happened. How odd. Kel counted and after a fashion arrived at dirfteen, that mythical number between fourteen and fifteen that had always been his favorite, and by then everyone was staring. Not at the clerks, but at him. Again, how odd.

Kel coughed awkwardly (living people still did that to cover up embarrassment, didn’t they?) and approached the counter. 

“I’d like to register for the… um…” He scrambled. For some reason the word just escaped him.

“The Wayfinder’s Association?”

Kel stared. Association? Heaven’s no! He’d never be part of any kind of association. Frankly the very notion was absurd and… And he wasn’t talking about a homeowner’s association was he? 

Kel squinted at the man.

“The guild? You are here to register for the guild?” The mildly portly clerk-human-thing asked him.

Kel nodded slowly. It was an autonomic response that occured whenever he needed to placate his master or most other higher beings but couldn’t fathom whatever it was they were trying to to communicate at him. Oh he knew the Speech and Otherese, and a good number of local dialects and languages besides. Even invented a few to optimize communications between his constructs. But bureaucratic nonsense like “registrations” was simply beyond his ken. His master had made sure of that. Paperwork was, and had been illegal in his master's many domains for quite some time. As had red tape. And most red colored objects actually; blood and viscera excepted, of course. Human blood was often red, and given his master’s predisposition towards humans, it was quite often on display.

“Okay. Then place your hand on the slate and wait just a moment,” the clerk-beast said as it pushed a perfectly flat, gray slab of stone across the counter to Kel.

Kel did as he was told and placed one of his horrifically bland appendages on the slate with his fingers mildly splayed. The gray of the stone beneath his hand turned a brilliant white almost instantly and a figure appeared displaying his [Aptitudes] and beneath it was his [Class].

“Well that’s a new one. Fleshcrafter?”

Kel nodded again, this time with regal ease. 

“It is but a small piece of what I am. But it IS the aspect of my profession I will be investigating for the foreseeable future.”

“Well. I don’t have any records of that one. We generally accept all kinds here, since Lumineon subsidies for Wayfinder’s guilds are fairly good. But…”

“I am an unknown quantity,” Kel finished the man’s thought.

“Er. Yes. Well, exactly.”

Kel nodded and provided the necessary clarification.
“Very well. Seven.”

Instead of immediately understanding his meaning, as Kel expected, the soft-boned man blinked at him in total non-comprehension. 

“Come again?”

“I said, ‘seven’,” Kel repeated, patiently. 

This man needed a brain transplant, and, unfortunately Kel was lacking the correct tools to provide him one or else he might have offered to do the routine procedure right then and there. He would have charged a modest fee, of course. Kel’s master had provided him very little currency for his trip by design. It was important Kel learned to pay his own way in the field. Kel was unconcerned. He would succeed because he was a master of his craft, and his craft was divine.

“Seven?” The clerk-beast was squinting now. A micro stroke probably.

Kel shook his head sadly because he knew that the strokes would probably come more often over time. This poor soul was not long for the world.

Don’t worry, Kel thought, when I bring you back, you next life will be happier.

“He means his level, Callis.”

“I know that!” the clerk-beast (apparently appropriately named Callus) said scowling at his female colleague before turning back to address Kel.

“Still. We’ll need some verification of that. Our equipment is… err, faulty. Our equipment is faulty and can’t read levels right now!”

Kel only vaguely knew what a level was. His master had explained they were granted by the primitive Power Grid analogue this universe had. His master had called it a “System” with a capital “S”, and like his [Class], his level came from it. Regardless, Callus was probably lying about the organization’s equipment being faulty. The other clerks had slates too and there was no way they were all defective in the same manner. Likely this “Association” had skimped out on buying quality equipment. It made sense. This was a backwater little town mostly populated by humans, the dumbest of races.

“Well. I am not actually sure what level I am now, “ Kel  admitted.

“I do know my EIQ-delta since arriving in this land is about seven. Upon arrival a quick calculation determined it to be a three, and by midday it had changed to a four, and by the time I happened across this unique specimen–”

Kel took a moment to retrieve the monster core from his satchel and, with a thought, transformed it back into the reptilian corpse he had found in the forest. It only took a moment for the soft orb of wispy light to decompress into a heavily muscled canine-esque quadruped, with a bladed ridge atop its long snout. Truly it was a magnificent specimen and Kel was so glad he had come across its corpse in the woods and not whatever had killed it. A large section of its spine and the back of its throat were missing. A shame. It was often difficult to produce quality work when you didn’t have complete sets of vertebrae.

“–By the time I had acquired this wonderous specimen, my calculations suggested my number was perhaps seven. Maybe an eight,” Kel finished.

The room went quiet for just a moment before all the ruckus started back up again. This time there were a lot more glances shot Kel’s way, though for what reason Kel was unsure.

“Ah. Well. If you can bring down an amph, you are probably at least level seven. I’ll collect your fee and get you all signed up then. I’m sure you’ll advance quickly and be a great benefit to our Association.” 

The probably-dying-but-did-not-know-it-pudgy-clerk-beast puttered about, poking at the stone state a few times and then turned it back around and slid it back over to Kel.

“Just sign there,” Callus said, pointing at what was obviously a signature line below some dense informational paragraphs.

Kel nearly drew his knife and stabbed the man through his throat.

Paperwork!!

Though he did not stab the clerk-beast, Kel did snarl and put his hand to his knife.

On the other side of the counter, the clerk-beast stumbled off his stool and took a few staggering steps back as he eyed the hand Kel had on his knife nervously. Meanwhile, Kel heard the scrapes and clicks of a few metal weapons being drawn behind him. 

They really ought to sharpen their weapons. A good sword barely makes any noise when drawn properly, Kel thought, glumly, as he took his hand off his weapon and raised his palms placatingly.

“Apologies. I have had… BAD experiences with…”–he shuddered involuntarily–”paperwork…” It wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t the full truth either. All experiences with paperwork were BAD experiences, and his master made sure no one within his domains ever had to have any. Paperwork was illegal within his beautiful realms. Nonetheless, Kel had seen it in his previous life and in his dealings with his master’s counterpart, The Timeless One. He knew the look of the accursed, thought eating phenomenon. He also knew how to ward himself against it.

Carefully, Kel drew the Sign-Against-Paperwork on the signature line and sighed with relief when it held. He knew its magic worked when Callus looked at what he had written and nodded as if everything was in order.

“So you're foreign? I’d have never known. How do you pronounce that?”

Kel thought about it, and decided giving his name to the clerk-beast was not the same as giving his Name to the blighted manifestation of pure bureaucratic evil on the slate.

“Kel. Call me Kel-Thusad.”

****

After his registration, Kel knew his next order of business was to fashion his first construct in this bizarre new land. But a man was not without his tools and his master had denied him his request to bring any. Kel was a very old and accomplished craftsman and even before he began his illustrious career as Vizier to the Mournful Throne he had studied at the finest academy his birth world had. As smart as Kel was, his master was smarter. If his will was that Kel-Thusad bring no tools with him to this strangerous world, then there was surely a reason for it.

Perhaps the tools to be had here would be superior? It was hard to imagine, as Kel’s laboratory had been outfitted with tools from across the Hoard. Nothing was denied to him. Anything he had asked for he had received. But as much as it seemed impossible to Kel, the fact remained that if his master wanted him to collect fresh tools from the local area, then that was to be the most beneficial course of action. Actually, the more Kel thought about it, the more he realized that the lesson he was meant to learn was most probably how to do better work with inferior tools. He couldn’t imagine what the point of having such a skill would be given that after this journey was over he would be returning to his lab and his nearly perfect instruments, but for now Kel would play along with his master's game. He was no Silver Sentinel or Stargazer. Unlike his colleagues, he had never once managed to fathom one of their lord’s plots.

And I much prefer it that way. Keeps things fresh and fascinating.

So with a smile in his heart, Kel set off to find a venue where he could purchase at least the basic supplies for his craft. It seemed that this quaint little town was lacking in technology. That was fine since Kel had been forewarned. Still, they had to have somewhere he could purchase a bonesaw. But the more he saw of the town's dirt roads and plain people the more dread built in him. There was not one single undead or unloving in sight and no one with obvious biological or cybernetic enhancement either. It seemed that he was going to have to rethink his assumptions about the local culture.

Plainswell was a small but growing frontier town built on the edge of where a large forest (whose name Kel had not yet learned) butted up against the Dire Plains. He had yet to be informed what exactly had caused those plains to be called “Dire” but he did notice that the enormous stone and wood wall around the town was considerably higher and thicker on the plains facing side. He was eager to get to working with some of the local fauna but had to tend to an extremely annoying amount of foundational work first. The least complex of which was acquiring the proper tools.

After asking around in the streets like some kind of common beggar, he was eventually informed of the location of several well-known shops that sold medical equipment. Upon frequenting the first he had immediately spun on his heels and strode out. It was clear that Vin’s Elixirs only sold potions and the like: bizarre because “elixir” generally meant “proven solution” and so he had taken the store for medical general goods. His second stop, Kylie’s Care, was more to his liking. Inside he could bandages, gauze, and suture equipment on display behind sterile glass. 

“Excuse me, miss, could you please direct me to the shop owner. I have some questions that…” Kel trailed off when he noticed the death-glare the young woman was directing his way.

“I AM the owner! I’ve had it with you wayfinders constantly assuming that I’m too young to own it!” The young lady yelled, her deep aqua eyes wild with rage.

Kel took a few involuntary steps back. He was used to dealing with unruly patients, many of whom were usually quite large and fearsome. Ordinarily he would not have been even mildly alarmed, however, his current body was fragile and he was painfully aware of that fact.

Kel’s blond haired aggressor took a deep sigh and, within moments, plastered the fakest smile he had ever seen over her rage.

“I’m sorry, sir. It’s been a trying day. What can I help you with?”

“I–” Kel found himself at a loss for words.

The girl stared at him patiently. 

“I’m looking for a bonesaw… And a few scalpels. And I’d like to inquire about the kinds and grades of bandages and sutures you have on… display?” Kel almost lost his trail of thought again when he registered the look of confusion on the girl’s face.

“Why would anyone sell a saw made out of bone?” 

Kel frowned. Clearly he would need to be more clear.

“Well, it is a quality material that can take a large number of different kinds of enchantments. Not to mention it is in much easier supply in most regions than metal. But… The bonesaw is just a saw that can cut bone and doesn’t necessarily need to be made out of it. Neither do the scalpels. Any durable material that can hold an edge will do.”

“Okay,” the young woman in white said, “what is a scalpel?”

****

An immeasurably long time later, Kel and the young lady proprietor, whose name turned out to be Kylie, were still arguing.

“I don’t understand! You say people can use healing magic or potions to address most injuries, but what about gangrenous regions?”

“I told you. We just cut those off!”

“Yes. And putting aside how primitive and wasteful it is to cast aside decent tissue like that, you’d still do so with a scalpel!!” Kel cried.

“No! Knives work just fine!”

Kel gagged. Actually gagged. The barberism! 

“Again. Knives DO NOT offer the control or precision of a scalpel! When performing a surgery, such precision is paramount!”

“There you go again using made up words. Whatever your surgeries are, we don’t need them!”

“YES YOU DO!” 

Kel honestly could not remember the last time he had raised his voice at anyone who wasn’t an experiment. He couldn’t help himself. What this woman was proposing was preposterous. The idea that medicine could advance to the point that surgeries were unnecessary was fine, but that clearly wasn’t the case here. He had seen the death, debilitation and disease statistics for this world. They were one of the reasons his lord had chosen this place for Kel’s pilgrimage. Besides that fact, not everyone specialized in telekinetic magic or had the necessary psionic skil to carve or mold flesh without a proper implement. Even in a society we're purely remediative surgeries were no longer necessary there would surely be some need for surgeries of augmentation? In fact, in such a society there should be even more of a demand for Kel’s skills. So why were the bare minimum instruments of his craft MISSING??

Kel and the girlish proprietor shared one last glare. The look in her eyes promised Kel that if he ever set foot inside her shop again he’d be ground into nutrient paste. Fine then. She could have her pathetic wares. Kel would find better ones.

****

There weren’t better ones. Kel visited two more shops only to be told that scalpels didn’t exist, saws were for wood not flesh, and Kylie’s Care sold the best bandages and sutures in town. 

By late afternoon, Kel felt horrible. Defeated. Downtrodden and physically wretched. There was a weakness in his form that radiated from his abdomen and his thoughts betrayed him, wandering off on their own. It took him quite a bit of time sitting down on a bench to diagnose the issue: Food. His body required sustenance.

Wonderful. This form’s biological insufficiencies are now sidelining my true objectives for the basest of needs. Could this day get any more cursed?

Immediately Kel regretted the thought. It was always best not to tempt fate, even in one's own thoughts. You never knew who might be listening.

Shaking off his melancholy, Kel stood and set off in search of… What was it called again? Ah. Yes. Lunch.

It didn’t take Kel long to find an eatery. A small wooden building, but most of Plainswell was made of small wooden buildings. This one was tastefully painted red and gave off an odor of the most delicious flesh. It made Kel think of meat for some reason. It had been ages since he had enjoyed food of any kind. It was simply too inefficient to stop what he was doing all the time to imbibe it so he had done away with the need for nutrition entirely. In fact, it grated on him that he was having to take time away from his objectives now to acquire such nutrition. Kel hated this new living body of his so very much.

Alas, my desires are unimportant. If the Shadow of Change desires I wear a meatform, then a meatform I shall wear. There is a divine purpose to all of this. I know it. I just need to find the smallest glimmer of it.

But first he needed food. Kel sighed and headed inside the building.
****

Kel sat at a crowded bar rubbing practically rubbing elbows with the people next to him. If they could be called people at all. Privately, Kel had his doubts. At least the sandwich he had been able to purchase was Shadow sent. At least this one moment of his day was going well.

“Hey. You are that Fleshsculptor guy.”

Whyyyy? Why must something always derail my enjoyment or my productivity? Can’t a man eat a sandwich in peace?!

“Ah. Yes. I am. But it is actually Fleshcrafter.” Kel replied nervously. Why was someone talking to him?

“Yeah… So… What is that like?” 

Kel turned and regarded his lunch’s interloper. They were a slim but muscular human man dressed in torn robes and with a beaten metal pauldron and a dented cuirass. He was young, younger than Kel had been before he had shaken off his mortal coil. Short-cropped brown hair and clear blue eyes full of naivete. He seemed nice enough. Maybe it was his pride, but Kel found himself indulging the man.

“Well, I improve the living and the undead,” Kel said honestly. He was pretty sure that was how his class worked given its System description. It was also exactly as his lord had said, and his lord rarely lied except for his own amusement or a greater purpose, and those two things were really the same thing, weren’t they?

“Woh! So you could make me stronger? Faster? Better at dodging?”

Kel took another bite of his sandwich and nodded. Then, deciding not to waste any more time, shoved the rest of the bread-wrapped meat into his tooth-lined-face-pocket.

I could also make you a great deal smarter. You seem like you need it.

It only took a second for Kel to decide to do exactly that for this man. He could use a new friend who knew the area and his lord had described the concept of Wayfinder parties to him. He would need allies to survive.

“Necromancer,” a dark voice growled from somewhere behind him.

Kel turned in his seat, his cheeks still puffed out with enough food to make him resemble a chipmunk. Behind him, and a bit to the right was a fearsome looking man. Dark skin, bald save for a sharply profiled goatee, and cruel, hate-filled eyes. Kel barely had enough time to register the man’s gold-leafed armor and gleaming blade before the latter erupted in golden light and split him from his sternum to the crown of his head.
